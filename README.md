# Dockers Overview

### Why do you need Docker?
- The primary purpose of Docker is to enable developers to build and deploy applications quickly and easily, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. 
- Docker allows developers to create consistent, reproducible environments that can be easily shared with others. 
- Docker makes it easy to scale applications, since containers can be easily spun up or down as needed.

Some of the key benefits of using Docker:

- Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
- Consistency: Docker ensures that the application environment is consistent across different development, testing, and production environments.
- Isolation: Containers provide a level of isolation that helps ensure that applications and their dependencies are kept separate from other applications on the same system.
- Efficiency: Docker containers are lightweight and use fewer resources than traditional virtual machines, making them more efficient.

Overall, Docker simplifies the process of developing, testing, and deploying applications, making it easier for developers to focus on building great software.

### What are containers in Docker
- A container in Docker is a lightweight and standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 
- Containers run in a virtualized environment that isolates them from the underlying infrastructure, making them portable and easy to deploy across different systems. 
- Each container shares the same host operating system but has its own filesystem, network interfaces, and process space. Containers are created from Docker images, which are essentially a snapshot of a specific configuration of an application and its dependencies. 
- Docker provides a platform to create, manage, and run containers, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications in a consistent and reproducible way.
